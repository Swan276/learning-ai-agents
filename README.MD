# Learning AI Agents
I have uploaded the projects I built while learning AI Agents. The following are the projects categorized by week together with a demo video.

## Week 1
### Beauty Saloon Booking Assistant
A RAG agent built using python, langgraph, chroma db, gemini 2.0 flash model as the assistant and mxbai model as text embedding.
I have given it a bunch of tools to lookup shop information, services, policies, working shifts of stylists, available timeslots, and write access to make an appointment.
I have added few shot prompts have system instruction to use a persona, its core capabilities, provided tools, and some constraints. \
